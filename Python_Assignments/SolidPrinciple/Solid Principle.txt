SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of design principles for writing clean, maintainable, 
and scalable object-oriented code. It was introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) 
as a guideline to promote software design that is easy to understand, flexible, and robust. 
Each letter in the SOLID acronym represents a specific principle:
1)	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one responsibility.
2)	Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Objects should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3)	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4)	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5)	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than low-level details.
The adherence to SOLID principles in software design provides several key benefits:
	Scalability and Flexibility.
	Ease of Maintenance.
	Reusability.
	Testability.
	Team Alignment and Collaboration.
In general, adhering to SOLID principles helps create clean, organized, and flexible software design, improving code quality, ease of maintenance, and development in the long run.
